# Introduction
This repository consists of notebooks covering the primary code stacks and skills required to progress through machine learning and deep learning. The repository is targeted towards a graduate-level audience and is focused on deep learning concepts. It assumes that you have been exposed to traditional machine learning concepts, like supervised, unsupervised, and dimensional reduction. It also assumes you grasp frameworks such as scikit-learn, pytorch, and tensorflow. These tutorials will be initially written in JAX, to provide the most interpretable detail between mathematical proofs and code implementations.
